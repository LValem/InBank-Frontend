- Enter their national ID number.
- Adjust the desired loan amount and loan period using sliders.
- Submit the application and see either:
    - The approved loan amount and period (which may be adjusted by backend rules),
    - Or a helpful error message if their request is not valid.

## Features

### Country Selection
- Users must select a country before submitting an application.
- Country selection is done via clickable flag icons.
- The backend uses the selected country to apply age validation rules.

### Adjustments
- The frontend compares approved loan values with the user's requested values.
- If the approved loan is adjusted, the frontend shows a helpful note:
  > _"Note: Your request was adjusted for approval."_

### Validations
- Basic client-side validation ensures the ID is 11 digits long.
- The backend performs full validation, including age and value constraints.
- Errors are clearly shown, and users can fix inputs and resubmit.

## Components

### LoanForm
Displays the full loan application form including:
- National ID input
- Loan amount slider (from 2000â‚¬ to 10000â‚¬)
- Loan period slider (from 12 to 48 months)
- Submit button
- Displays backend responses and errors

Takes a `selectedCountry` prop from the parent and uses it in the API call.

### ApiService
The ApiService component provides methods for making API calls to the backend API.
It sends loan application information to the backend API and receives a response
with the approved loan amount and loan period.
